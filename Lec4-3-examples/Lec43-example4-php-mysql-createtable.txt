Rules:

In MySQL there are three main data types: text, number, and date


Data type 	Description
CHAR(size) 	Holds a fixed length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The fixed size is specified in parenthesis. Can store up to 255 characters
VARCHAR(size) 	Holds a variable length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The maximum size is specified in parenthesis. Can store up to 255 characters. Note: If you put a greater value than 255 it will be converted to a TEXT type
TINYTEXT 	Holds a string with a maximum length of 255 characters
TEXT 	Holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 characters
BLOB 	For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 65,535 bytes of data
MEDIUMTEXT 	Holds a string with a maximum length of 16,777,215 characters
MEDIUMBLOB 	For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 16,777,215 bytes of data
LONGTEXT 	Holds a string with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 characters
LONGBLOB 	For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 4,294,967,295 bytes of data
ENUM(x,y,z,etc.) 	Let you enter a list of possible values. You can list up to 65535 values in an ENUM list. If a value is inserted that is not in the list, a blank value will be inserted.

Note: The values are sorted in the order you enter them.
You enter the possible values in this format: ENUM('X','Y','Z')
SET 	Similar to ENUM except that SET may contain up to 64 list items and can store more than one choice






After the data type, you can specify other optional attributes for each column:

    NOT NULL - Each row must contain a value for that column, null values are not allowed
    DEFAULT value - Set a default value that is added when no other value is passed
    UNSIGNED - Used for number types, limits the stored data to positive numbers and zero
    AUTO INCREMENT - MySQL automatically increases the value of the field by 1 each time a new record is added
    PRIMARY KEY - Used to uniquely identify the rows in a table. The column with PRIMARY KEY setting is often an ID number, and is often used with AUTO_INCREMENT

Each table should have a primary key column (in this case: the "id" column). Its value must be unique for each record in the table.
